		<h2>Welcome to University of Southern California Badminton Club</h2>

		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p>USC Badminton Club is open to players of all levels! We offer both team and club options to USC students. The team is for players who want to go out and compete against other schools, while club consists of those who just want to come to practice to play recreationally and hit for fun. Our mission is to provide space for students from all backgrounds to enjoy badminton and make friends!  While everyone has different levels of experience, we are defined by our love of badminton. </p>

		<h3>Practice Schedule for Fall 2018</h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Location:</strong> PED 210 South Gym <br>
			<strong>Time</strong> Tuesday/Thursday 5:00pm - 8:00pm <br>
			<strong>Club Dues:</strong> $30/semester ($55 for the year) <br>
			<strong>Team Dues:</strong> $40/semester ($75 for the year) <br>
			Practice space and times will be shared among our club and team members. It is not necessary to come and play for the entire session, so feel free to come and go as you wish. A lot of people ask if they must practice during practice; the answer is "NO"! Practice is just a time for people to come together and play badminton, and no one is required to do any drills, training, or footwork. If you want any help learning or practicing some shots, other club members should be more than happy to help!

		<h3>Lyon Center Hours</h3>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, these are the only hours that the school gives us to connect with other badminton fans. However, the Lyon Center does have open gym hours for badminton each semester. This is completely free to USC students! Please see <a href="https://sait.usc.edu/recsports/facilities/facilities/informal-recreation/" alt="Lyon Center Informal Recreation link">this page</a> for more details.
