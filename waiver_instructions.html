		<h2>USC RecSports Waiver</h2>

		<h4>
			In order to comply with USC's legal requirements, USC Recreational Sports (which oversees the badminton club) requires participants to fill out the RecSports waiver. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WAIVER FOR THE LYON CENTER AND USC VILLAGE GYM! The RecSports leaders will come to practice to check that everyone at practice has a waiver. If you do not have it filled out, you WILL be thrown out of practice.
